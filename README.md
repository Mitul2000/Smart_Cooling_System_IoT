# Short project description

Our IoT project will be to create a smart Cooling system. The idea is to design and
create a smart fan which will sense the temperature at every certain interval to assess if the fan
needs to be turned on or not. The Fan is connected to a DC motor and will be connected to the
NODE MCU microcontroller. Furthermore, we will also implement an alphanumeric display
which will tell the user what the current temperature is. The backend will allow all multiple
devices to connect to the smart fan. Using the pub/sub architecture, we will pass sensor data
from the smart cooling system to a broker and from the broker, we will pipeline the necessary
data to a persistent database where it would be further analyzed and used by external
applications. Most of the logic will occur in the far edge of the system and specifically for our
case, it will happen on the microcontroller itself.
